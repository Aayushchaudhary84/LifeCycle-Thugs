## Requirements Details
Below are the lists of requirements.

### User Requirements:
- Users will be able to view earthquakes displayed on a map.
- Users will be able to filter the data by selecting options such as date, location, size, etc.
- Users will be able to share their results with others (social media sharing options).
- Users will be able to toggle different map views (such as satellite, terrain, etc).
- Users will be able to log into the system with a username and password.
- Users will be able to view and edit their profile.
- Users will be able to receive custom notifications from the system (such as a new earthquake of certain conditions), as well as removing notifications.
- Users will be able to view earthquake predictions.

### Functional Requirements:

- The application will get data from the USGS earthquake API, and then store the data within a database so that we can minimize the amount of requests from the API and provide quicker results to our users.
- The application will use the data stored in the database to display the data on a global map interactive map.
- The application will provide input fields so that users may filter the data. This will be done converting user input into a database query.
- The database will store a userâ€™s information such as login, password, and other fields.
- The application will provide social media links that will share queried search results (ex: if a user searches for all earthquakes between Feb 2 and Feb 17 2023, they will be able to share the link so that another user can view the same page and map).
- The application will provide data prediction for future events.
- The system will automatically send custom notifications to the users if the conditions (set by the user) have been met.
- An admin will be able to view and delete users and their notifications (for moderation purposes).
- The system will automatically send out password reset emails for users that have forgotten their password/login.
- The system will display the number of API calls and last time the API was called in an administration page.

### Non-functional Requirements:
- The backend programming will be done in python (flask).
- The system will not display any unnecessary data to other users or administration.
