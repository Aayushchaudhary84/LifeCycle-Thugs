-- Don't yet know how we will store these
-- I suggest: attributes text, for storing list of attributes in the filter as a string ie (magnitude > 5,location < 100km from (long,lat))
-- parsing the strings into useable conditions would then fall to the program processing them.

create table notification(
    notifyid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    userid Integer,
    Foreign Key (userid) References user(userid)
);

create table event(
    eventid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    title Varchar(50),
    url Varchar(255),
    magnitude Decimal(4,2),
    time DateTime,
    latitude Decimal(8,4),
    longitude Decimal(8,4),
    height Decimal(8,4)    -- need a better name for this (z coordinate)
