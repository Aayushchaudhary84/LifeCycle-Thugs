# Testing flask application from CLI

First make sure that you are in the make main directory (LifeCycle-Thugs)

Then you may simply run the command `pytest` to run all of your tests.

While debugging tests or wanting to print out any lines from the test use the `-rP` tag
so your command will be `pytest -rP`
