# IEEE Requirements Document Standard

1. Introduction

1.1 Purpose

The product `name here` is a web app that will deliver data visualization, data prediction, data filtering and map plotting of past earthquakes using the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Earthquake Hazards Program API. The website will include user features such as a registration system, notification system and dashboard.

1.2 Scope of the product

`Name Here` will provide its users with an easy to use system to view past earthquakes. The users will be able to filter the earthquake data based on location, time, strength, depth, and other factors. The software will use machine learning to be able to predict future earthquake sizes and locations. This software aims to aid the geological sciences by providing an easy to use platform to track geological disturbances, as well as for use by the general public who are interested in the monitoring of earthquakes. The web application will allow users to view earthquakes around the globe with real-time updates.

1.3 Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations

The United States Geological Survey will be known henceforth as USGS. USGS provides natural hazards, energy, water, minerals, and other natural resource data. It is from USGS that we will be acquiring the web applications data.

Application programming interface will be known as API. An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.  _Other abbreviations will go here_.
